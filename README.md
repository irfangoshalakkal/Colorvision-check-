Hi All !!
I lost my career in Chemistry because of something I didnâ€™t know I hadâ€”Color Blindness.

After finishing my Master's degree in Chemistry, I was diagnosed with color vision deficiency. By then, it was too late.
My dream of becoming a chemist was no longer viable. Had I known earlier, I would have chosen a different pathâ€”maybe entered IT much sooner, where Iâ€™m now slowly building my second career.

ðŸŽ¯ That experience inspired me to build something meaningful.

Iâ€™ve created a simple *Color Vision Checker* to help others detect color blindness early:

If a tool like this had existed when I was a student, my life would have taken a different turn much earlier.

Iâ€™m sharing this not just as a IT Guy â€”but as someone who has lived the cost of late diagnosis.
Please *share this tool with students, teachers, or parents.* Early detection can save careers.

Letâ€™s prevent others from suffering the same fate.
